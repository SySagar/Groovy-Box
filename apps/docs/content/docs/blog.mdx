## Motivation

I was very much inspired by [ShadCn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and always wanted to try out design my own components. I was curious how such scalable and robust
components were made for speedy development. Hence I did some research and got to know about the concept of design systems.

Besides this, I had the first exposure of this during my internship when I had to bootstrap and entire design system for our organization.
Glad that my mentor explained me a hell lot of details and I was happy to finally work on something cool. I followed a lot of open source and famous ui kits and took hours studying their codebase just to develop one of my owns.

Groovy-Box may not be perfect, but I tried my best to develop this and will keep improvising with time as it grows. If you really appreciate the
work please do give a star to my [repo](https://github.com/SySagar/Groovy-Box). This really motivates me a lot.
